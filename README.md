# Chess 

### Introduction 

Chess is a project that I worked on in the summer of 2022 while learning how to code in Python. Later, I used it to learn how to use Git and Github and decided to optimize it along the way. 

### How to play Chess 

The project Chess follows the basic rules of Chess. The program includes checkmate, stalemate, en passant, promotion, the 50 move rule, and other special features of chess. 

In order to play through the program, you can play either yourself or a friend. If playing a friend, both people need to be using the same device to type in their moves. The program is very easy to follow, as instructions are given along the way. You choose a piece to move, what square you want that piece to move, and the console displays the board the entire way through, along with information about what side is currently making a move, how many moves have been made, and what the previous move was.
